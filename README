Development
-----------

This buildout branch can be used to test the proxied ssl middleware. To get it 
running, perform the following steps:

1. run ``python bootstrap.py``
2. run ``bin/buildout``
3. run ``bin/django runserver``

These steps will attempt to checkout the package from github with a read only 
url. If you wish to use the packaged version of the product, you will need to 
run ``bin/develop d proxiedssl`` and then ``bin/buildout`` again.
